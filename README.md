Project Title: IDENTIFICATION, CHARACTERIZATION, AND ANALYSIS OF ROTORCRAFT FLIGHT MANEUVERS USING SIMULATED FLIGHT DATA

Domain of problem: Rotorcraft flight transportation and safety

Problem Statement: This project utilizes helicopter simulation data to predict a specific maneuver performed. We will likely use a wide variety of data with 100+ parameters to create a model that will accurately predict a maneuver. This allows for the ability to triage possible loss of control instances and identify these triggers before the loss of control occurs. By foretelling these possible issues, pilots are able to prepare for harsh conditions and be ready to mitigate risk.

Importance of problem: There are certain series of rotorcraft flight maneuvers that may bring fatal results, especially when helicopters are often used in emergency scenarios.
